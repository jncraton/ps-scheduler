Fair-share Scheduling
=====================

This lab explores the two [fair-share scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair-share_scheduling) implementations. In particular, it includes a [lottery scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_scheduling) and [weighted fair queueing scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_fair_queueing).

Provide correct implementations for the `schedule_lottery` and `schedule_wfq` functions.

Testing
-------

Your code can be compiled and tested via simulation by running:

```
make test
```
